BigYin is a video sharing application.

People all over the world want to share their opinions on elections and referendums because they matter.  But the nature of social media means we rarely hear the voices of those that disagree.

So that's why we're different.  You don't decide who's voice you hear but you can decide whether you agree or not.

Users can watch and upload one minute videos.
