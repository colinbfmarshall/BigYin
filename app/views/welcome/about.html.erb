        <h4>Why?</h4>
        <p>
          Because politics is a battle of ideas but in the course of a healthy debate we need to listen.
          <br><br>
          We've become so secure in our own bubbles that we never challenge our opinions or political outlook.  We rely on social media or hand-picked news outlets to reinforce our opinions.
          <br><br>
          And increasingly, we've become so secure in our bubbles that we accept only information, whether true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that’s out there.
          <br><br>
          Voters' Minute wants to change that by giving everyone a chance to give their opinion on what matters to them.  Who knows, your opinion may change someone else's.
          <br><br>
          We don't all agree but that doesn't mean we shouldn't listen, so you don't pick who you listen to next, it's random.
          <br><br>
          So this is your chance to <%= link_to "add your voice", new_user_registration_path, style:'color:#FF534B' %> to the debate.
          <br><br>
        </p>
        <h4>How does it work?</h4>
        <p>
          It's simple:<br><br>
            •  Pick an issue that matters to you<br>
            •  Record your one minute video<br>
            •  Upload your video
            <br><br>
            Users can choose the topics they're interested in but the videos on the topic are played in a random order.
        <br><br>
        </p>
        <h4>Why only one minute?</h4>
        <p>
          Because one minute is plenty of time to make a good argument.
        <br><br>
        </p>
        <h4>Who will see my video?</h4>
        <p>
        These videos are to help undecided voters and hopefully make some question their position.  Anyone visiting can view the videos and they're selected at random.
        <br><br>
        <h4>Can I share videos on Social Media?</h4>
        <p>
        Please do if there's social media sharing buttons under the video.
        <br><br>
        </p>
        <h4>Why can't I comment on videos?</h4>
        <p>
        Because there's too much hate on the internet already.
